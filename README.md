# AutoScanPOC
<p>The goal of this project is to help automate some of the mundane tasks of web application recon.<br />
There are two main goals of this project:</p>
* To automate as much as possible while still allowing modifications throughout the process by us the human as there are many things that automation can miss.
* To help cut past some of the excess noise by trying to dial in on web apps/domains that are more likely to have been forgotten about or misconfigured.
