# AutoScanPOC
The goal of this project is to help automate some of the mundane tasks of web applicaiton recon. 
The plan is to automate as much as possible while still allowing modifications throughout the proccess by us the human as there are many things that automation can miss.
The other goal is to help cut past some of the excess noise by trying to dial in on web apps/domains that are more likely to have been forgetten about or misconfigured.
